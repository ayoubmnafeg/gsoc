Greetings! I am Ayoub MNAFEG, a hail from Tunisia. My passion for technology has been with me since my childhood days, and it has been a driving force in my life ever since. I am a graduate of the Higher Institute of Technological Studies of Sfax, where I received an education that allowed me to explore and develop my interests in Technology.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I have also spent eight years volunteering with the Scouts. This experience has given me valuable leadership and team management skills that have proven useful in my personal and professional life. When I'm not working, I enjoy a game of chess as a way to challenge myself and expand my thinking.

I am excited about the future of technology and the endless possibilities it presents. I am constantly seeking new ways to grow and learn, and I believe that with dedication and hard work, I can make a meaningful contribution to this field.

Noticing the presence of Wagtail in the list brought me immense joy, knowing that I can now contribute to this Python-based CMS. This opportunity presents a chance for me to broaden my expertise in the language. I had the pleasure of training several students of my age in various colleges in Tunisia, which was an enjoyable experience. With two Django projects already under my belt and some experience in data science libraries, I am eager to participate in GSOC and contribute to the open-source project of Wagtail. Joining this prestigious initiative would be a fantastic opportunity for me.
