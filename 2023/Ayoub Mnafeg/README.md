## Introduction

Greetings! I am Ayoub MNAFEG, a hail from Tunisia. My passion for technology has been with me since my childhood days, and it has been a driving force in my life ever since. I am a graduate of the Higher Institute of Technological Studies of Sfax, where I received an education that allowed me to explore and develop my interests in Technology.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I have also spent eight years volunteering with the Scouts. This experience has given me valuable leadership and team management skills that have proven useful in my personal and professional life. When I'm not working, I enjoy a game of chess as a way to challenge myself and expand my thinking.

I am excited about the future of technology and the endless possibilities it presents. I am constantly seeking new ways to grow and learn, and I believe that with dedication and hard work, I can make a meaningful contribution to this field.

Noticing the presence of Wagtail in the list brought me immense joy, knowing that I can now contribute to this Python-based CMS. This opportunity presents a chance for me to broaden my expertise in the language. I had the pleasure of training several students of my age in various colleges in Tunisia, which was an enjoyable experience. With two Django projects already under my belt and some experience in data science libraries, I am eager to participate in GSOC and contribute to the open-source project of Wagtail. Joining this prestigious initiative would be a fantastic opportunity for me.

## Tasks

### Checklists

We use checklists so all candidates demonstrate their interest and skills with the same process. They will help you get started and make sure you’re on the right track.

#### Checklist: Google Summer of Code

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through. It’s a good idea to start early, so you can get to know the community and the project.

- [x] Watch the official [‘Introduction to GSoC’ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD2tChhrWM&feature=youtu.be).
- [x] Read [Advice for People Applying for GSoC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-advice).
- [x] Read all of Google’s [contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/)
- [x] Read the official [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and add the most important dates as reminders on your calendar.

You’ve done the hardest bits! Now all that’s left is for you to:

- [x] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/discussions/1) discussion thread.

### Checklist: open source contributions

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).
- [x] Clone this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHub’s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [x] Your Twitter profile if any
  - [ ] Your Mastodon profile if any
  - [x] Your LinkedIn profile if any
  - [ ] Your personal website
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your participant file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to make all of the above changes in a single pull request.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [ ] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description).

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within this `gsoc` repository in the `2023/` folder.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific GSoC project idea you’re interested in.
- [x] Go through our projects under the [wagtail organisation](https://github.com/wagtail) in GitHub. Create a new list with links to repositories or specific issues you would be interested in contributing to during the internship.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 6 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Django and Wagtail

Here, we expect you to go through two tutorials to demonstrate your understanding of Django and Wagtail. Submit the code from both projects you will have created either by adding links to GitHub repositories with your mention, or directly in this `gsoc` repository, in your named folder under `2023/`.

- [x] Go through Django’s [Getting started documentation and tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/), until part 7.
- [x] Go through Wagtail’s Getting started tutorial: [Your first Wagtail site](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html)
